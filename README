This program is Exercise 3.9 from the Unix Systems Programming (Kay A. Robins & Steven Robbins) textbook.

For help: ./proc_fan -h

To run: ./proc_fan -n [INTEGER] < [EXECUTABLES] (Integer specifies process limit)

Basic funiction:

   Main loop:
      -Read from standard input until end-of-file is reached.
      -If process limit is reached, wait for a child process to finish.
      -Use fork, makeargv, and execvp to execute a program from a child process.
      -Check if any child processes have finished.
      -After end-of-file is reached, wait for remaining children to finish.


   testsim is the accompanying executable:
      -Runs the sleep function within a for loop.
      -Number of loops and duration of sleep determined by arguments.
      -Prints PID during each iteration of the loop.


   Included is a testing.data file:
      -Run using the following: ./proc_fan -n [INTEGER] < testing.data


   The code for makeargv was obtain via the textbook.
